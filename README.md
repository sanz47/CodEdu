# 🎮 Code Quest  

**Code Quest** is an **endless, interactive, level-based educational game** built in Python using **Pygame**.  
Players explore a colorful world where each challenge teaches a **Data Structure** concept such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs.

## 🕹 Game Concept  
- **Title:** Data Structures Quest  
- **Type:** Endless, Level-based Learning Game  
- **Goal:** Navigate through a vibrant world where each “portal” is a challenge about a specific data structure.  
- **Graphics Library:** `pygame` for visuals and interaction.  

---

## ✨ Main Features  
- **Interactive World Map** – Move your character to portals representing different topics.  
- **Multiple Challenge Types:**  
  - Fill in the blanks (**code completion**)  
  - Multiple-choice quizzes  
  - Visual simulations of how data structures work  
- **Endless Mode** – Randomized challenges so learning never ends.  
- **Visual Animations** – Watch nodes being added to a linked list or stack push/pop in action.  
- **Progress System** – Earn coins/stars for correct answers, unlock harder challenges.  
- **Fun Obstacles** – Avoid “bug monsters” that slow your progress and teach debugging.

## 🔄 Game Loop  
1. Move character with arrow keys.  
2. Enter a “portal” to start a challenge.  
3. **If correct** → get animation + reward.  
4. **If wrong** → get a hint + retry.  
5. New challenge is generated automatically.  
6. Difficulty increases over time.  
7. Loop continues endlessly!

## 📚 Example Challenge Types  
- **Array Level:** Arrange numbers in sorted order by swapping.  
- **Stack Level:** Visual push & pop simulation.  
- **Queue Level:** Serve customers in correct FIFO order.  
- **Tree Level:** Match traversal orders (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).  
- **Graph Level:** Find shortest paths interactively.
